## Summary
```
1. Changed the cards class to a flex container, have its flex item children wrap around, and justify content with space-around (two times the space length in between) ... along main axis.
2. Change the col class to an inline-flex container. This allows the element to behave like an inline-level element (MDN).. this allows for the child of col class to be arranged along main axis or cross axis. Used justify content: space-between to align the first image of each col to each other. More space can be seen in the middle/second column to allow for the third image of second column to align with the third image of first & third column.
